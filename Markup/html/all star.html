<body>
    <div> Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me </div>
    <div>I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
        <div>She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
            <div>In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
                <div>Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
                    <div>Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
                        <div>Didn't make sense not to live for fun
                            <div>Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
                                <div>So much to do, so much to see
                                    <div>So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
                                        <div>You'll never know if you don't go
                                            <div>You'll never shine if you don't glow
                                                <div>Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
                                                    <div>Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
                                                        <div>And all that glitters is gold
                                                            <div>Only shooting stars break the mold
